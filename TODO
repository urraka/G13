System
  - iOS: callbacks for touch/movement events.

Graphics
  - Test buffer state keeping
  - Add Image class which loads PNG into a memory buffer.
  - Make texture class use Image class and add ability to load from buffer.
  - Add mipmaping support with glGenMipmaps and GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP or whatever (for 2.1)
  - Add text rendering.
  - Add shader type to VBO object so it binds it for you.
  - Add lineWidth method to Graphics.
  - Move glewInit to system module to remove platform specific code in graphics module.

General
  - Sort headers again so Graphics doesn't depend on useless stuff.

Math
  - Add some overflow checks in fpm functions (example: in dot(), if (x.x or x.y > 175 warning! 175*175 = 30625))
