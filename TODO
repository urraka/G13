Game
  - Consider making components private with methods to access as const.

Debugging
  - Add global Debugger object which everyone has access to.
  - Move the debug drawing to Debugger object.
  - Move all debug outputs to debugger object.
  - Think of a way to remove Debugger calls on release mode.

System
  - iOS: callbacks for touch/movement events.
  - Switch to GLFW3 (when ready).
  - Revisit keyboard/char input stuff.

Graphics
  - Test buffer state keeping.
  - Add Image class which loads PNG into a memory buffer.
  - Make texture class use Image class and add ability to load from buffer.
  - Add mipmaping support with glGenMipmaps and GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP or whatever (for 2.1).
  - Add text rendering.
  - Add shader type to VBO object so it binds it for you.
  - Add lineWidth method to Graphics.

Math
  - Add some overflow checks in fpm functions (example: in length(), if (x.x or x.y > 175 warning! 175*175 = 30625))
  - Consider using int64 in some functions if necessary.
